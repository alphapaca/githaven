### Vision

The target if this project is to make ideal workspace for people who want to do some hacking and host it on a private vps/raspberry pi/etc.

#### Key features

- minimal memory footprint
- issue tracking
- ci/cd (infra as code of course)
- monitoring: to see if something have eaten all memory/disk, and also
- github/gitlab mirroring

#### Apparently not targets

- self hosting for big companies. If you are big - go fuck with github/gitlab
